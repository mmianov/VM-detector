# VM-Detector
* Author: Mateusz Mianowany
* Affiliation: Warsaw University of Technology
* Thesis subject: Analysis of the methods implemented by malware to detect virtual environments 

## What is it?

**VM detector** performs multiple checks of host system and execution environment to determine
whether it is being run in a virtual environment or a sandbox. It performs the same checks a legitimate
malware would so that it does not showcase its behaviour when being analysed. 

This project is currently in early stages of development.
